Hi, I’m currently undertaking the final year of my Higher National Diploma(HND) in Computer Science, and I’m open for job opportunities.

I work mostly with Javascript, Django, and SQL.

I'm mostly on Twitter ([@geraldelorm](https://twitter.com/geraldelorm)).

I write on my ([DEV](https://dev.to/geraldelorm)) blog quite often.
